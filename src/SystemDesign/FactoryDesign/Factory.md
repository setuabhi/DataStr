1. Factory design pattern came in picture when we needed Centralized Object Creation and hide object creation from client, basically it's encapsulation of object creation 
2. The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object
in the client code.

we have 3 thing here.
1. Interface
2. Concrete classes which will implement Interface (Circle, Rectangle)
3. Factory class which will be responsible for creating and returning objects of Concrete classes
4. Client code without Concrete classes object
