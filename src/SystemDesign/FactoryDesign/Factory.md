1. Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be created without the client knowing the exact class being instantiated.
   The client (main method) only requests an object, and the factory decides which concrete class to return.
2. It encapsulates the process of creating objects, so the client does not directly use the new keyword.
3. Factory class has static method which will create objects and return using if else to client (main)
